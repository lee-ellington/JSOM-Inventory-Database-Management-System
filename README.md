# JSOM-Inventory-Database-Management-System

This utility has been developed to digitize the asset tracking system of JSOM.
In it's current state, the user can search, add, edit, delete, or display asset data.

The following are the features that are slated to be developed:
  - Server based MySQL database
    - Database schema to be updated to allow for appropriate data to be tracked.
     - Asset#, Office#, User Name, NetID, Date, Description (Model), Serial#, Service Tag, Date Returned
  - AD SSO
  - Log of changes made to assets throughout their lifetime (e.g., old location, old user, old user NetID)
  - Surplus feature that sends an asset to a different table that can not be edited but contains relevant info on the asset. 

After the above feaures are added and confirmed to be working as intended, the utility will be deployed for use. After a trial period of 4 weeks,
the teem will present their critiques and recommendations on how to improve the application.
